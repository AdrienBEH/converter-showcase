# Converter Showcase
An Angular app showcase for **Cr√©dit Agricole CIB** interview.

## Prerequered
Make sure you have a **cleaned localStorage**.

The application does not manage data conflicts if it is launched on a domain that has previously been used by another application that has filled the localStorage. By logic, this case only exists when launching the application in localhost.

## Install
Run `npm ci`.

## Start
Run `npm start`.
The application run on **localhost:4200**.
